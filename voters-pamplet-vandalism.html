        <h1>Vandalizing Multnomah County's Voters' Pamphlet</h1>
        <p>
            Portland Public Schools put forward a bond renewal, Measure 26-259, to modernize the remaining high schools
            (Cleveland, Ida B. Wells), follow-through on the 2020 bond to modernize Jefferson High School, and address a
            long-standing maintenance backlog of elementary and middle schools, including seismic upgrades.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the <a href="https://multco.us/file/multnomah_county_voters%27_pamphlet_may_2025.pdf/download">Voters'
                Pamphlet</a>, immediately after the superintendent's formal summary of the measure, readers find
            an argument "in favor" (p.81) that urges to "vote YES on this bond because nothing says 'It's for the
            children'
            quite like bankrupting taxpayers to build half-empty schools!"
        </p>
        <img src="voters-pamplet-vandalism-argument.png">
        <p>
            (The "half-empty schools" is referencing <a
                href="https://www.wweek.com/news/schools/2025/03/19/too-many-high-schools/">local media coverage</a>
            that cites <a
                href="https://www.pps.net/cms/lib/OR01913224/Centricity/Domain/207/PRC_PPS_Forecast_Report_AY2023_withAppendix.pdf">
                Portland State University's forecast</a> predicts <a
                href="https://www.oregon.gov/ode/reports-and-data/students/pages/student-enrollment-reports.aspx">enrollment</a>
            will decline through the 2032 school year, but the news articles omit that the narrative of the report then
            says "before beginning a recovery" with the projection showing net positive enrollment by '39. Notably, that
            is as many years out as PPS has been engaged in modernization.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Because Oregon has been voting by mail since the '90s, readers will have experience approaching the pamphlet
            arguments with some skepticism. This particular argument, "furnished by Eric Fruits," is more than falsely
            labeled opposition, however.
        </p>
        <img src="voters-pamplet-vandalism-video.png">
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4qZnyfvQm8&t=244s">Mr. Fruits is outspoken in his opposition to
                the measure</a>, and has been organizing opposition to the current series of PPS bonds since they were
            first proposed in 2011. This context is important to the argument in which he says that the measure will
            "give PPS a blank check!" and have "no accountability." Meaning he is:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Familiar with the pamphlet and would know that it's first come, first print, with arguments in
                favor appearing before opposition.
            </li>
            <li>
                Aware that the bond has an active, independent <a href="https://www.pps.net/Page/464">Bond
                    Accountability Committee</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Aware that the school board separately commissions <a href="https://www.pps.net/Page/15137">Bond
                    Audit Reports</a>.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Information in the pamphlet is published as-is. Like Wikipedia. And if it were Wikipedia, the information
            would categorize as vandalism. Eric Fruits is vandalizing the county's Voters' Pamphlet in order to
            prominently catch reader attention in an act of deliberate disinformation.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's the overarching concern: the voters' pamphlet is at times the only reliable source of sufficient
            information and it has been vandalized.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <em>UPDATE, Mon May 19, 2025</em>: County election officials replied clarifying that the Oregon statute ORS
            251.415 (to review whether an argument is listing correctly as in favor or opposition) only applies to state
            measures.
        </p>
        <p>
            This incident is a case study for information security of election materials: if the arguments
            list first come first serve regardless of position, then there would be no issue. But since the in-favor
            arguments print first, the process is subject to abuse.
